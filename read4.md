# Javascript and Jquery
**Query** _is a lightweight , "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website_

__On the web javascript code live inside the (HTML) document and needs to be enclosed by <script> and </script> and we can put the script tag anywhere in the HTML document__

 **A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it**



Document.write : is what we need to write the text into our HTML document

We can also use standered HTML to customize the appearance text in the output 

## Variables : 
Declaring a variable by using the Keyward **Var** :

**Var x = 10 ;**
Document.write (a) ;
We use **semi-colon (;)** to terminate any programming expression 

 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
Expressions evaluate into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.


1.EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE

var color = 'beige';

The value of color is now beige.

2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
var area = 3 * 2; The value of area is now 6.

## OPERATORS :
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
 Assign a value to a variable
 color = 'beige'; 
- The value of color is now beige.

- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 
Perform basic math area = 3 * 2; 
The value of area is now 6.

 - STRING OPERATORS 
Combine two strings 
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly'; 
The value of greeting is now Hi Molly

- COMPARISON OPERATORS
 Compare two values and return true or false
 buy = 3 > 5; 
The value of buy is false. 

- LOGICAL OPERATORS
 Combine expressions and return true or false
 buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 
The value of buy is now true

## STRING OPERATOR 
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.

For example, you might have a first and last name in two separate variables and want to join them to show a full name. In this example, the variable called full Name would hold the string 'Ivy Stone'. 
var firstName = 'Ivy ' ; 
var lastName = ' Stone' ; 
var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName ;
