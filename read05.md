# LOOPS :

## Definition:
 _Loops are a programming element that repeat a portion of code a set number of times until the desired process is complete. Repetitive tasks are common in programming, and loops are essential to save time and minimize errors._

- There are three types of loop: **for**, **while**, and **do ... while**. Each repeats a set of statement

###### Why We Use Loops:
 **Loops make code more manageable and organized. As we learn more about programming and writing complex programs, loops will be an important element to understand and use.**

# Comparison and Logical operators:
- Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==.

- Logical operators — operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output.
  The operators  include: &&, ||, and ! . Which allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 

-	All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
