# Version Control:

## Version Control : is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes

*Types of VCS*
- Local Version Control:
A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

- Centralized Version Control :
This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. 

-Distributed Version Control :
(DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. 


## Git :  is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
